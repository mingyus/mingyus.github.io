I am a Research Scientist at Meta, working on building better recommendation systems at large scales. I am passionate about understanding human behavior through experimentation and data analysis.

I received my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Princeton University in 2022, advised by [Yael Niv](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/). In my dissertation, I studied animal and human representation learning, using a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling.

Before that, I completed my B.S. in Physics and Psychology in Peking University (2012-2016). I was an undergraduate research assistant with [Hang Zhang](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/people/lbd/sopacs/220156.htm) and [Jian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IBegxO0AAAAJ&hl=en) at Peking University, where I studied proactive information sampling in value-based decision making. I was a research assistant with [Wei Ji Ma](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/) at New York University in summer 2015, where I studied the explore-exploit tradeoff in human sequential decision making.
