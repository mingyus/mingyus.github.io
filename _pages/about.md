I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in [Yael Niv's lab](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton Neuroscience Institute, where I study representation learning, using a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling. My thesis project studies how humans learn about rules in multi-dimensional environments with probabilistic feedback.

Before that, I completed my B.S. in Physics and Psychology in Peking University (2012-2016). I was an undergraduate research assistant with Professors [Hang Zhang](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/people/lbd/sopacs/220156.htm) and [Jian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IBegxO0AAAAJ&hl=en) at Peking University, where I studied proactive information sampling in value-based decision making. I was a research assistant with Professor [Wei Ji Ma](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/) at New York University in summer 2015, where I studied the explore-exploit tradeoff in human sequential decision making.
